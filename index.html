    <h3><a name="about"></a>About Me</h3>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>I was born way back in 1992. This year was particularly important to Kenyan politics as it's the year when the first multi-party elections were held; since our Independence in 1963.</p>
        <p>I was born in Nairobi, the first-born in my family.</p>
        <p>We moved around a few times in my infancy and early toddler ages but finally settled in Nairobi's outskirts: a place known as Thindigua, near Kiambu Town.</p>
        <p>My parents really don't like that name "Thindigua". The area is alternatively known as Windsor Grove.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of my earliest interests was music. I love music. It's what I do effortlessly. Trust me on this.</p>
        <p>I've also always been fascinated with Computer/Video Games. This fascination almost reaches levels of addiction.</p>

        <h4>My professional background:</h4>
        <p>I took this programming class because it's an open secret that technology has become an integral part of our existence.</p>
        <p>You can say it's just strategic placement for future opportunity.</p>
        <p>I've always loved computers. The very first computer I used was an IBM PC 5150. It had no GUI, and because I just had to play some old game (Lambo?) I had my first interactions with the Windows CMD terminal. I wasn't that good.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I've studied Business Management at Diploma level, where I specialised in Procurement.</p>
        <p>I also study Chinese Language and Culture but I'm on a hiatus.</p>
        <p>NB: Chinese is <em>really hard!</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Luckily, I've had a few chances to work, including:</p>
        <div class="work">
          <ol>
            <li>2013-2015: Worked for Zakache Security Services as a Data Analyst.</li>
            <li>2015-2015: Worked at Solvit Tuition Center as an English Language and I.T. Tutor.</li>
          </ol>

        <p>The image up there is a statue of an Asura; a Far East demi-diety. Buddhism considers birth as an Asura one of the 4 Unfortunate Rebirths among them birth as an animal, a preta or a being in Naraka.</p>
